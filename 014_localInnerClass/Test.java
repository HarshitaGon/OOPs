/*
    üîç Key Concepts:
    1. Local Inner Class:

        * A class defined inside a method (here: show()).

        * It behaves like a local variable ‚Äî only accessible within the method.

        * Cannot be accessed outside the method.

    2. Effectively Final Variable:

        * A local variable is effectively final if its value is not changed after it's declared.

        * num is not explicitly marked final, but since it‚Äôs never modified, it is treated as final ‚Äî hence, accessible inside LocalInner.

    3. Outer Access:

        * You cannot access this LocalInner class or its method from outside the show() method.

        * So, even from main() or another class, you can't directly call display() ‚Äî you can only call show().
